If you want more freedom, you will need to learn GML.</div><div class="q" data-v-e20deadc>How much does the engine cost?</div><div class="a" data-v-e20deadc>The full release of PFE costs $30.

Check your graphics card settings and make sure the refresh rate of your monitor isn&#39;t above 60. If you&#39;re using a laptop, set it to &quot;best performance&quot;. On large monitors, use fullscreen mode instead of resizing the window.

(similar to superarmor, but the hurtbox owner will not take any damage), and &quot;reflector&quot;\r\n- Added shield poking (and the option to disable shield poking)\r\n- Adjusted shield sizes to better cover character&#39;s hurtboxes\r\n\r\nAttacks\r\n- General balance changes and animation updates\r\n- Added/fixed precise hurtboxes for multiple moves\r\n- Added Homing Attack\r\n- Added Laser Turret (fspec1)\r\n- Added Magnet Zone (dspec1)\r\n- Added Hadoken\r\n- Added a new Up Tilt for Blocky\r\n- Added a new Nair for Polygon\r\n- Added a new Up Tilt for Polygon\r\n- Added Scalar&#39;s entire moveset\r\n\r\nFunctionality\r\n- Added Teams (and Team Attack)\r\n- Added a setting for Ledge Hogging\r\n- Characters can now be assigned a &quot;draw_script&quot; which will override the default draw\r\n- Characters can also be assigned an &quot;overhead_script&quot; which will draw at the same time overhead elements are drawn\r\n- Added the options to display player name and damage overhead\r\n- Replaced the hitbox &quot;priority&quot; variable with the &quot;check_first&quot; variable, which determines if the hitbox gets checked before other hitboxes or not\r\n- You can now set a limit to the number of times an attack can be used\r\n- Added a &quot;magnet_speed&quot; property for magnetboxes that controls how fast targets are moved to the magnet coordinates\r\n- Added more hitstun formulas, and changed the default hitstun formula to scale with the target&#39;s damage\r\n- Added a &quot;custom_shield_damage&quot; property for hitboxes\r\n- Added a regrab timer to prevent chain grabs\r\n- Player states now have &quot;start&quot;, &quot;normal&quot;, and &quot;stop&quot; phases to replace putting unique state code in &quot;state_set&quot;\r\n- Added the macro camera_enable_rounding, which determines if the camera coordinates are rounded or not\r\n- Added two new attack cancel scripts, &quot;cancel_dash_check&quot; and &quot;cancel_any_action_check&quot;\r\n- Added support for Dpad movement\r\n- You can now make hitboxes only hit grounded opponents, or only hit aerial opponents\r\n- Added support for loading values from a file during gameplay, to speed up development\r\n- Added a proper combo counter\r\n- Added the function switch_character to allow changing characters during gameplay\r\n- Added hitbox on-hit scripts\r\n\r\nFixes\r\n- Fixed an issue where the player with the most damage would win when the time ran out, instead of the player with the least damage\r\n- Fixed an issue where the stamina on the character select screen would not be set correctly after playing a match\r\n- Fixed an issue where the game would try to play sound effects that didn&#39;t exist for certain moves\r\n- Fixed an issue where players could end up off the ground when moving up slopes\r\n- Fixed an issue where vertical knockback would be negated if a player was standing on two or more moving blocks that were moving downwards\r\n- Fixed an issue where dropping through a downwards moving platform could result in the player staying on top of the platform while still being in the aerial state\r\n- Fixed an issue where if players were hit by a windbox while running they would slide backwards until they stopped running\r\n- Fixed an issue where characters with different collision boxes than normal would not spawn on top of platforms correctly\r\n- Fixed an issue where when two players grabbed at the same time, one player would get the grab based on port priority. Now, both players will enter the grab release lag\r\n- Fixed an issue where if a player grabbed another player, they would not be knocked back by any attacks on that frame.
